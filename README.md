# Earn QLC rewards from sharing your wifi, Qlink brings about disrupting rewardful Wifi sharing experience！


## dApp Description

Qlink Wifi sharing dApp, is the first Qlink product featuring peer-to-peer sharing of Wifi assets utilising blockchain technology. This disrupting technical breakthrough is bringing about Wifi asset registration and rewardful Wifi sharing experience to the users.

Qlink Wifi sharing dApp users are allowed to connect to registered Wifi on Qlink at anytime from any location, instead of storing the Wifi passwords on a central server, Qlink supports the P2P transmission of passwords between the Wifi hot-spot owners and the Wifi network users, which largely ensures the security of Wifi network.

When a Wifi hotspot is registered as a digital asset on the public chain, it turns available to all Qlink users with the encrypted password kept to the Wifi owner locally. For the first time ever, Wifi sharing could result in QLC rewards transferring from the Wifi users to the Wifi owners. Thanks to the deployment of smart contract, a certain number of QLC will be credited to the Wifi owner 
based on the former’s pricing settings.

By adopting a cross-chain protocol between the Qlink Chain and NEO blockchain, the dual chains communicate to synchronise the registration of telecom assets as digital assets, they also enable data usage being kept on the Qlink network. Users’ data consumption has never been so transparent and secured.
