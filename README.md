### Qlink dApp Intro

### What is Qlink dApp

----

  Qlink dApp is the first dApp developed in the Qlink ecosystem with VPN & WiFi Sharing and Wallet functionalities. It features peer-to-peer sharing of VPN & Wi-Fi assets backed by blockchain technology.
  
### Features

------

* This disruptive technical breakthrough enables users register VPN & WiFi assets on NEO chain in a decentralized way, share it with Qlink users and be rewarded by QLC token.

* Qlink dApp users can connect to registered assets on the Qlink blockchain anytime anywhere. Different from a central server, Qlink doesn’t store users’ passwords. It supports the on-premises P2P information transmission between the VPN/ Wi-Fi owners and users, which will largely ensure the security of network.

* The dApp also features wallet function which holds QLC and supports direct token transaction.

* WiFi and VPN service usage record will be kept on the Qlink chain, which communicates with NEO chain via a dual-chain protocol. Users’ network services consumption has never been so transparent and secured.
