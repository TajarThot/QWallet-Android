# Qlink MVP dApp 1.0.7  13.02.2018


#### dApp Description

Qlink Wifi sharing dApp, is the first Qlink product featuring peer-to-peer sharing of Wifi assets utilising blockchain technology. This disrupting technical breakthrough is allowing users to share WiFi assets in a decentralized way and being rewarded for that.

Qlink Wifi sharing dApp users are allowed to connect to registered Wifi assets on the Qlink blockchain at anytime from any location. Instead of storing the Wifi passwords on a central server, Qlink supports the P2P transmission of passwords between the Wifi hotspot owners and the Wifi network users, which largely ensures the security of Wifi network.

By adopting a cross-chain protocol between the Qlink Chain and the NEO blockchain, the dual chains communicate to synchronise the registration of telecom assets as digital assets. They also enable data usage being kept on the Qlink network. Users’ data consumption has never been so transparent and secured.
