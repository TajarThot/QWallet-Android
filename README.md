  Qlink dApp is the first dApp developed in the Qlink ecosystem with VPN & WiFi Sharing and Wallet functionalities. It features peer-to-peer sharing of VPN & Wi-Fi assets backed by blockchain technology.
  
### Features

------

* This disruptive technical breakthrough enables users register VPN & WiFi assets on NEO chain in a decentralized way, share it with Qlink users and be rewarded by QLC token.

* Qlink dApp users can connect to registered assets on the Qlink blockchain anytime anywhere. Different from a central server, Qlink doesn’t store users’ passwords. It supports the on-premises P2P information transmission between the VPN/ Wi-Fi owners and users, which will largely ensure the security of network.

* The dApp also features wallet function which holds QLC and supports direct token transaction.

* WiFi and VPN service usage record will be kept on the Qlink chain, which communicates with NEO chain via a dual-chain protocol. Users’ network services consumption has never been so transparent and secured.


### New in version 1.1.1

1. Instant Messaging

The new IM feature tends to facilitate connections between digital asset owner and other users. When the owner is P2P online, users can start a chat by clicking the owner’s picture. Powered by the blockchain technology, Qlink dApp provides the most secure network environment.

2. Other general bug fix and performance improvements
